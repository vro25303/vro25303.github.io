            The purpose of this project is to create a soothing, calm picture. I believe that I got to achieve this. I also got to create this with very different images that show my interests. The building picture shows the appreciation I have towards sleek architectural design. Bees are one of my favorite animals to see photographed. They always look so majestic when the pictures are taken. Another thing that adds to that appreciation is the contrast that exist between the bee’s bright yellow color and the bright colors of the flowers. The mountain shows how majestic nature is.

            The main theme that I wanted to show in this composition is the endangerment of bees. Both of the sides points us to the bee image in the middle by using diagonal lines.  Making the bee the centerpiece, the main focus of the image. This is because I wanted to show how both sides are contributing into the bee issue. The building represent how manmade edifications are destroying the home of many bees. The mountain shows how climate change is making it so bees and flowers cannot work together as well as the used to.

              This project was inspired by one of my favorite albums of all time, Tyler, the Creator’s “Flower Boy.” The text used and the outline of me filled with flowers portray this. The colors in it are also loosely inspired by the cassette cover of this album. I think that symbolically it shows the contrast between the dull outside and the blooming inside, pun intended.

              The color scheme that is loosely used in the main objects of the image is the complementary colors scheme. The orange-ish yellow background contrasts very well with the dominantly violet in the inside of the figure in the middle. This is also present but less noticeable with the text. The brown text also has a light pastel pink next to it that makes it feel kind of three dimensional. I think that the contrast between the warm and the cool colors really worked well with the idea I had.

              The logo that I chose to recreate or reimagine was the logo of my father’s company: Virgilio Rodriguez & Asoc. The main reason why I chose to do that company is because of how archaic the logo looks. This logo was imagined by my father in the 90’s. I had to keep some of the components of the former logo to make it still have some essence of the old logo. Although the creative process to get to this new logo was kind of time consuming, I believe that the end product was worth it.

              After many ideas that raced my head I ended with an idea that took some inspiration from a logo for an architecture firm called “Romane - Vanoverschelde.” That logo is made by combining the letters “RV” into a single figure made by a single line. I took that idea further and by reorganizing the original letters and adding an “A” I ended with the “VRA” logo.
